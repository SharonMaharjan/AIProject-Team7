How do you do a custom yolo training to distinguish hronets from other classes because yolo can ditinguish up to 1000 classes

get the custom job working and then add more data. don't label too much hornets.

Start off with bees

yolo version 8 or 5 probably for training the custom yolo job.


Asir:
- Scrap images (not too many)
- Try different labeling tools, and stick with that one. Maybe, Roboflow.
- Do custom YOLO training job with Jupyter Notebooks

- First start with Bees only.
- Work in an agile way. If it worked add more data and train again.
